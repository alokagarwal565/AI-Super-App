* **Bcrypt**: For secure password hashing and user authentication.
* **pdf-parse / PyMuPDF**: Libraries for extracting and parsing content from uploaded PDF and TXT resume files.

### AI Model Integration
* **Replicate API**: Integrates with cutting-edge models for image and video generation (e.g., Flux LoRa for face conditioning, Deforum for video generation).
* **HuggingFace APIs**: Used for custom-trained face generation models (LoRA).
* **Gemini API / Other LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)**: Powers natural language processing tasks, including parsing, rephrasing, and enhancing resume data for portfolio generation.

### Database
* **SQLite (Development)**: Lightweight database for local development.
* **PostgreSQL (Production)**: Robust relational database for scalable production environments, storing user data, credentials, and usage logs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The AI Super App follows a modular and layered architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and future expansion.


### Key Components:

1.  **User Interface Layer**: Built with **React/Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing intuitive interfaces for user authentication, content generation prompts, resume uploads, and viewing generated outputs.
2.  **Application Logic Layer (Flask Backend)**: Handles API requests, user authentication, credit management, and orchestrates calls to external AI services.
3.  **AI Model Interaction**: Manages communication with **Replicate**, **HuggingFace**, and **Gemini APIs**, sending input data (prompts, face images, parsed resumes) and receiving generated outputs.
4.  **Storage and Database Layer**: Utilizes **SQLAlchemy** for data modeling and queries, **bcrypt** for secure password hashing, and stores generated content (image links, website templates) in user galleries.
5.  **Output/Rendering Layer**: Renders generated media (images/videos) and HTML-based websites in real-time on the frontend, with options for download or temporary hosting.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js & npm (or yarn)
* Git
* API keys for Replicate, HuggingFace, and Gemini (or other LLMs)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alokagarwal565/AI-Super-App.git
    cd ai-super-app
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
    *Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your API keys and database configuration:*
    ```
    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_replicate_api_key"
    HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN="your_huggingface_api_key"
    GEMINI_API_TOKEN="your_gemini_api_key"
    DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///site.db" # Or your PostgreSQL connection string
    SECRET_KEY="your_secret_flask_key"
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # Or `yarn install`
    ```
    *Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add your backend API URL:*
    ```
